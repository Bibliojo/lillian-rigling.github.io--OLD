In November 2016 I eagerly boarded a train in Raleigh, NC headed north to Washington, D.C. in anticipation of attending the mythic, life-changing "OpenCon" conference. It was only two short days after the U.S. presidential election, which had shaken me to my core, and I had been looking forward to this trip to get myself through it. "I'm going to be around like-minded people," I thought to myself, "And we're going to change the world."

I didn't know what to expect from OpenCon.
