### Challenge

Why did you feel it was a challenge? What was so challenging about it? Why was it your challenge?

</section>

<section data-markdown>

### Choice

Why did you make the choice you did? Where did you get the courage – or not? Where did you get the hope – or not? How did it feel?

</section>

<section data-markdown>

### Outcome

How did the outcome feel? Why did it feel that way? What did it teach you? What do you want to teach us? How do you want us to feel?

## Challenge. Choice. Outcome.
