In November 2016 I eagerly boarded a train in Raleigh, NC headed north to Washington, D.C. in anticipation of attending the mythic, life-changing "OpenCon" conference. It was only two short days after the U.S. presidential election, which had shaken me to my core, and I had been looking forward to this trip to get myself through it. "I'm going to be around like-minded people," I thought to myself, "And we're going to change the world."

I didn't know what to expect from OpenCon. Beyond the fact that it would supposedly change my life, I hadn't heard too many concrete things. The programming had only been released a few short days before, and was still evolving throughout the conference. Being a planner (and a librarian), this made me nervous. I like knowing what I'm getting into, carefully picking and choosing which sessions I will attend. I like seeing learning outcomes and outlines down to the minute ahead of time (any instruction librarians out there?). Needless to say, this was not the typical librarian-type conference I spend time at, and I was out of my comfort zone.

Walking in on day one, though, the room was buzzing with energy, and it was easy to put that all in the back of my mind. By the time I had grabbed a tea and sat down, I'm pretty sure I had met people from at least 4 continents. Though I found the librarians (we tend to gravitate to each other), I had also met students, activists, lawyers, researchers, and a mish-mash of other genuinely wonderful humans who, out of the goodness of their hearts, felt pulled to the open movement.
