## LIBRARIES. OPEN CULTURE. UX.

I'm Lillian Rigling. I'm a librarian who is passionate about advancing open research practices at universities. I spend my day-to-day doing outreach for students, faculty, and staff, discussing how open ethos can enhance research practices, and how it affects scholarship at every level. I also try to incorporate scholarly communications concepts into library instruction for students of every level, and make these concepts tangible and accessible.

## Current Interests and Projects:

- Using design thinking and user research for service and space design
- Open education advocacy at the student level
- Early-career scholarship and academic activity
- Open pedagogy and open educational practice.
